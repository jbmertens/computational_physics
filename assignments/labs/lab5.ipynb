    "The Kortewegâ€“de Vries (KdV) equation approximately describes the amplitude of waves in certain one-dimensional systems, for example the height of water waves in a shallow trough.  There is a class of static solutions to this equation where waves will hold their shape while the system is not disrupted.  In the real world, the KdV equation includes time dependence - a more difficult problem we will not examine yet.  However, you have likely seem some examples of static wave configurations in flowing water, such as stationary ripples in a creek or stream.  Extreme examples of this are even [surfable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6f8oLu8t8M)!\n",
