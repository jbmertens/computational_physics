Monday:


  ? Can you think of physical systems whose dynamics are, or can be mapped, to solving a system of linear equations?
    You've hopefully seen some examples in LA class.
    Any linear system! Includes systems described by differential equations.
      -- classic examples: systems of springs, circuit analysis

  - Linear algebraic systems: solutions
    Solving Ax = b
    - Gaussian elim. for system of linear eqs.
    - LU decomposition instead

    Show that linear diff. eqs map to linear algebraic systems
      (Quantum mechanics, Wave mechanics)
      (Electro/Gravitational systems (poisson))
      (Linear Markov/Stochastic processes)

    Solving Ax = 0 (Null space)

  ? What is eigenstuff useful for?
   -  Eigenstuff... make a better ?n
      monte carlo ex.

  - Eigendecompositions
    review eigenstuff... recall eigenvectors, eigenvalues, determinants
    Functionality exists in python
    Matrix inversion--the PDP way

  - Something more fun and interesting
    SVD / PCA
     - Ax = b
     A = U w VT
        U, V can be funny dimensions
        Want: VT V = 1
              UT U = 1
        General procedure:
          find Eigenvectors of AT A, A AT:
          AT A = V wT UT U w VT = V wT w VT -> V is the matrix that diagonalizes AT A
          A AT = U w wT UT -> U is a matrix that diagonalizes AT A.
        => columns of V, U are eigenvectors

        What about the null space vectors?
        If x is in null space of A, it will also be in the null space of (AT A)
        A x = 0
        = (AT A) x
        = (V wT w) (VT x) = 0 <- The row space is orthogonal to the null space;
                                 so non-trivial rows in VT actuall span the
                                 null space; provide an orthonormal basis that spans the null space!

        (Pseudo) inverse: A^-1 = V 1/w U^T
        set 1/w = 0 if w = 0 !
        Gives AT A AT = AT,
              A AT A = A

    Applications: least squares (Monday)
                  principle component analysis (provides a "basis" for data least variance)
                  (See: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.1100.pdf)
