    "Here we will look at an example of a system that appears in models of fluid dynamics. This system provides us with an example of why it can be so hard to develop general software to obtain solutions to partial differential equations: different systems can exhibit drastically different behavior and numerical stability properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore the so-called Burgers' equation, which models viscous fluid flow. The Burgers' equation is a simplified one-dimensional form of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, which are useful for describing fluids in one-dimensional systems. This can be used as a toy model for fluid flow through pipes, or even a simple model of traffic flow. The Navier-Stokes equations are, in turn, closely related to equations describing other systems you may have encountered, including the Boltzmann equations describing conservation of a phase-space distribution, and the geodesic equation in gravitational systems.\n",

    "Examining this equation, it looks like a combination of the advection and diffusion equations. It behaves accordingly! The second-derivative term describes viscous interactions in the fluid, with $\\lambda$ the coefficient of viscosity. The first-derivative term serves to transport the system similar to the advection equation, however the advection speed is now given by the fluid velocity itself, $v$, instead of a constant."

Plot all of these curves simultaneously. As the resolution increases, the solution should appear to be \"converging\". Note that, because $\\Delta t$ is written in terms of $\\Delta x$, the timestep resolution is also increased when we do this, so we are testing increases in both the spatial and timestep resolutions. *Note: You may notice something odd happens at the lowest resolution; we will explore this more below.*"
