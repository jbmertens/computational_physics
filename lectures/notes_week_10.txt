Monday:
  Conceptual: difference between ODEs, PDEs, Integration?
    in terms of A(f(x),x)

  Integrals: syntax,
    integral error estimate?

  ODEs: syntax problem
    set up a system problem

  Classifications of PDEs: Hyperbolic, parabolic, elliptic
  PDEs: Write Maxwell's equations as a set of PDEs to integrate?
    boundary conditions

  stability of ODEs, PDEs




Friday (exam):
  Written: conceptual integration, ODE, PDE:
           Richardson extrapolation (is there a min. dx?)
  Written: Set up PDE

  Compute: conceptual ODE, integration
  Compute: integration problem, ODE problem
