Monday: 

  - stability of ODE integration

    Example--?

  - implicit ODE methods



  ---

  - Numerical integration:
      Tabulated ("known") function: simps, trapz
        Richardson extrapolation ~ higher order ()
        Idea: variable transformation to transform infinite range integrals
        or to eliminate singularities (NR. p. 173)

      Analytically "known" function
        scipy quad(rature) function handles this-


  What about infinite integrands, or singular functions?



Friday:

  Monte-carlo integration?
  Convolutions?
