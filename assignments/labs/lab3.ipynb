    "## Infinite Square Well\n",
    "\n",
    "As always we begin by solving a problem with a known solution.  One of the first problems we solve in quantum mechanics is a single particle in an infinite square well.  Here $V(x)=0$ for $0<x<L$ and is infinite outside this region.  Where the potential is infinite the wave function must be zero.  This means $\\psi(x)=0$ for $x\\le 0$ and $x\\ge L$ and we only need to solve for $\\psi(x)$ on the finite interval $0<x<L$.  In other words, this problem is described quite well by the matrix form we derived in the homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "To proceed we will let $L=1$ and discretize the region using 1001 equally spaced points ($N=1000$ equal length segments).  We can almost use the `Hamiltonian` function you copied from the homework, but with a small detail.  The boundary conditions we have for the infinite square well are that $\\psi(0) = \\psi(L) = 0$.  In the discrete version this means $\\psi_0 = \\psi_N = 0$ where $N$ is the number of segments.  In our function from the homework we required $\\psi_{-1}=\\psi_{N+1}=0$ so we need to make a small change.  One way to proceed is to solve for the wave function at $\\{ x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{N-1} \\}$.  In other words, do not solve for $\\psi_0=\\psi(x_0)$ or $\\psi_N=\\psi(x_N)$ since we already know they must be zero and *by construction they will be zero*!  Stop and think about this, it is a simple idea but can be confusing.  Effectively this just reduces the size of the matrix $\\mathsf{H}$ and changes the points at which the eigenvectors will been evaluated.\n",

    "Construct the matrix $\\mathsf{H}$ for the infinite square well using the parameters from above.  As stated above, the Hamiltonian we construct is not quite right.

This sounds like a job for array slicing!\n",
