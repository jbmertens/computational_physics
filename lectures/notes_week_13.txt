- Random number generators
    Pseudo: formula to get random number given a previous one
      MT alg: "recurrence" relation to cycle through all possible numbers in a ~6000 digit number
        (2^19937 âˆ’ 1 bits)
    vs. "True": exploit some random physical process;

  Bad RNG example --

- RNG distribution
  Another task: given a certain distribution, draw from another distribution:
    PDF transformation
    P(a<x<b) = \int_{x_a}^{x_b} dx p(x)
             = \int_{y_a}^{y_b} dx/dy dy p(x(y))

      g(y) <=> dx/dy p(x(y))

  - Example problem



- Transition matrices
  (eg. weather)
