    "## An aside: some basic $\\LaTeX$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks, such as this one, provide both code and documentation.  The documentation includes formatting through *Markdown* and equations using $\\LaTeX$.  We will become more familiar with some aspects of creating documentation througout the semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are unfamiliar with $\\LaTeX$, it is one of the best systems available for typesetting documents, particularly those involving mathematics, and is a standard tool used in communicating results in the sciences (at least in physics).  It was written over 40 years ago by Donald Knuth in response to electronic proofs of a book he had written.  At the time, publishers were switching from hand typesetting to electronic typesetting of documents.  The proofs were so poorly typeset that he wrote his own system.  This includes tools for creating fonts and a complete set of fonts with all the needed mathematical symbols (something nonexistent at the time and only recently can you find complete sets of fonts which include mathematical symbols).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will get a brief introduction to typesetting simple mathematical expressions.  These can appear in the documentation in the notebook but also in figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "To typeset a formula we use $\\LaTeX$ in markdown cells.  There are many examples of this in notebooks. You can look at the unformatted text in any notebook by double clicking on the cell containing the text. To insert an equation, the dollar sign, `$`, is used to denote where the equation begins and ends.  In notebooks, you should wrap any latex code in dollar characters.\n",
