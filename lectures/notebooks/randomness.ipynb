One easy way to see this is to perform a calculation using every 3rd random number generated. Recall that you can select every 3th element in array by specifying a step: calling `br[0::3]` will access every 3rd element beginning with the 0th one. Define $x$ to contain every third element starting with the 0th one, $y$ starting with the 1st one, and $z$ starting with the 2nd. Finally define $i = 9x-6y+z$.\n",

Generally, transforming one probability distribution to another is a type of [integral transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_integral_transform).

This time, because we are interested in evaluating this as a probability distribution, you should make sure to supply the `density='true'` option to `hist` in order to correctly normalize the distribution. Last, apply the coordinate transformation, and plot the distribution function of the transformed numbers."
