    "## A \"Real\" Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now take the first step toward creating a real plot.  The default plots created by `matplotlib` are \"ok\", not great, but with a little effort we can make them very nice.  We will work on this more throughout the semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we will improve the plot we made above.  The `random.normal` function is suppose to pick random values from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance.  We will test this by plotting the histogram along with the expected curve for a Gaussian distribution.  To do so we will proceed as follows.  All code should be put in the cell at the end of this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate 10,000 random numbers using `np.random.normal`.  Store them in some variable (use whatever name you prefer).\n",
    "2. Find the minimum and maximum values from your array: find appropriate functions and use them.  Print the minimum and maximum values using the `print` function.  (Note: There are a number of ways to do this, you only need to find one.)\n",
    "3. We would also like to plot the *expected* Gaussian on top of the histogram.  A general Gaussian is given by\n",
    "$$ f(x,\\mu,\\sigma) = \\frac1{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\!\\left[ -\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\!\\right], $$\n",
    "where $\\mu$ is the mean and $\\sigma$ is the variance (width) of the Gaussian.  (What are the *expected* values for $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ for the distribution used by `random.normal`?)  Unfortunately, if you plot this function on top of the histogram, they will not lie on top of each other correctly.  (You should try this!)  The problem is that this function is normalized, but our histogram was not.  This is easy to fix.  Once again look at the documentation for `hist` and notice that it has a `density` keyword.\n",
    "4. We are now ready to plot the Gaussian.  To do this use the `plot` function.  When you look up its documentation you will find it has many, many options.  It is good to play with some of them.  The most useful ones for now are those that allow us to change the color, style, and width of the line. (Hint: We also need to *calculate* the Gaussian.  This uses functions like exponentiation and square roots and a constant, $\\pi$.  Naturally there are functions defined to do these operations and the value of $\\pi$ is also available to us.  In what module that we have already loaded would you expect them to be in?  What do you expect them to be called?  Often things will work out as we expect.)\n",
    "5. If you have performed the steps given above you now have a plot, but not a very useful plot.  It contains a histogram and a line, but what are these things?  What are we suppose to learn from the plot?  There are a few things we should **always** do whenever we make a plot.  Here are a few things to do to get us started:\n",
    "  1. Label the axes.  What is on the $x$ and $y$ axes in the plot?  The labels on these axes should be descriptive so that at a quick glance we know what is being plotted.  (Hint: Look up `xlabel`.)\n",
    "  2. Title the figure.  For this course you must **always** add a title to your figures.  When a figure is included in a paper you write it has a caption so a title is not always necessary. \n",
    "  3. *Suggested:* Add minor tick marks.  By default only the major tick marks (with tick labels) are created.  A figure almost always looks better with smaller ticks in-between the larger ones.  These can be turned on using `minorticks_on()`.\n",
    "6. Finally, put all of this together into a single code cell below that prints the minimum and maximum values and also produces the required plot."
