Monday -- 

 - introductions: name, especially pronounciation, if you have a nickname if different than what I 
    name, year, department; fun fact 

 - go over syllabus:
     For labs / group assignments. How should groups be divided?
     Options: will let you complete individually if you like
              or work in group (I'll assign.)

 - big range of students; grading structure hopefully reflects that.
   Expectations for grad students will be much higher than underclass.

 - Group structure?

 ?-- who has used python? For what?
     -- Anything you liked about it? didn't like?
 - python -- why python? (slides)
    Other languages: julia is up & coming, https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/python3-gcc.html
    Python notebook -- use anaconda
      Welcome to use co-lab; really should install jupyter (anaconda)
      Work (esp. research) can be done in plain text files, assignments will rely on notebooks.



 - convergence-- Square root of 8.
   - Exercise: Can you think of methods to compute this?
   Work through 3 of these: perturbation vs. iterative (vs. root finding?)

 - Numbers_and_Precision.ipynb


 - homework 1 due Thursday.






Friday -- 
  20-30 m
  - hw review

  - Arrays_Vectors.ipynb

  - Sources of error:
     - precision (eg. from finite number of digits-- discussed this some last class)
     - truncation (eg. in root-finding methods we saw; last example in notebook, finite-difference)
     - Discretization from function representation at a finite number of points (incl. resolution, again e.g. finite difference method)

  -? Do you know of, or can you think of of any problems where each source of error matters?
     Guessing is ok! Try to justify your idea.

     - Precision: Chaotic systems; solar-system (N-body) integration
     - Truncation error: time-integration, lattice simulations (finite differencing)
     - Discretization error: Simulations of 'shocks' / discontinuous behavior
 
     Need to make sure errors don't "blow up" !
     - Stability issues (also lab)
        - alg. stability -- explain golden ratio from num. recipes? don't go into detail.


     Any examples of this?
      - Stability: Inverse diffusion processes: become ``ill-posed'' at some point.
              Related to numerical GR problems; one of the major challenges in the 60s-late 90s was how to simulate black holes


  - group activity:
