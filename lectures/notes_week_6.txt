Monday:

  - Ordinary differential equation integration

  Euler's method


  ? How to improve upon Euler's method?

    - Richardson extrapolation
    - Multi-point methods
    - Runge-Kutta methods
      explicit vs. implicit
    - "Adaptive" step size

  Example: 
    odeint vs. solve_ivp

  Can we solve higher order equations, or multiple equations simultaneously
    Multiple equations & re-write as higher-order equations



Friday:

  - Multi-point ODE methods

  - Boundary value problems: shooting
