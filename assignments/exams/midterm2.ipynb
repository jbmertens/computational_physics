    "The Lane-Emden equation describes a self-gravitating, spherically symmetric, polytropic fluid.  It is often used as a (rather) simple model of a star.  A polytropic fluid is one that satisfies the polytropic equation of state, $P \\propto \\rho^{1+1/n}$, where $P$ is the pressure, $\\rho$ is the density, and $n$ is called the polytropic index.  Written in dimensionless form the Lane-Emden equation becomes the second order differential equation:\n",

    "$$ \\frac1{\\xi^2} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\xi} \\left( \\xi^2 \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\xi} \\theta(\\xi) \\right) + \\theta(\\xi)^n = 0. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\xi$ is a dimensionless radius and the function $\\theta(\\xi)$ is related to the density (and so is also related to the pressure) in the fluid.  You can see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane%E2%80%93Emden_equation\">Wikipedia</a> for a brief discussion and derivation.  For our purposes, this is just a differential equation we can solve numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solve the Lane-Emden equation for $n=0$ and $n=2$ using `solv_ivp` and the initial conditions $\\theta(0)=1$ and $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\theta}{\\mathrm{d}\\xi}(0)=0$.\n",
    "Note that this system of equations has a coordinate singularity at $\\xi =0$. There are several ways we can work around this. Here, we can just begin integrating at a small, non-zero value of $\\xi$, e.g. $\\xi = 10^{-8}$.\n",
    "Integrate to a large enough $\\xi$ so that $\\theta$ becomes negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint: For the $n=0$ polytrope, solve_ivp may take a very large step, and the resulting solution will not be sampled well enough to produce a nice figure. To improve this, you can specify a maximum step size, e.g. specify `max_step = 0.01` when using `solve_ivp`.*"
