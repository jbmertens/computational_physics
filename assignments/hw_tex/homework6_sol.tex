\begin{problem}{1} The second-order multi-point method

  \begin{subproblem}{a} We should arrive at a formula similar to
    \[
      f(x+\Delta x) = f(x-\Delta x) + 2 \Delta x A(f(x), x)\,.
    \]
  \end{subproblem}
  \begin{subproblem}{b}
    Given $f = f^{\rm true} + \epsilon$, we have
    \[
      f^{\rm true}(x+\Delta x) + \epsilon(x+\Delta x)
      = f^{\rm true}(x-\Delta x) + \epsilon(x -\Delta x) + 2 \Delta x A(f^{\rm true}(x) + \epsilon(x), x)\,.
    \]
    Assuming the true solution satisfies the result from part a, and expanding $A$, we have
    \[
      \epsilon(x+\Delta x)
      = \epsilon(x -\Delta x) + 2 \Delta x \epsilon(x) \left. \frac{\partial A}{\partial f} \right|_{x}\,.
    \]
  \end{subproblem}
  \begin{subproblem}{c}
    We would like the following inequality to hold true for stability,
    \[
      \left| \epsilon(x+\Delta x) \right| \le  \left| \epsilon(x) \right|\,.
    \]
    Substituting in the result from part (b), letting $\partial A / \partial f = \lambda$, and simplifying,
    the condition becomes
    \[
      \left| \frac{\epsilon(x -\Delta x)}{\epsilon(x)} + 2 \Delta x \lambda \right| \le 1\,.
    \]
    Whether the inequality holds will thus depend on the precise values of the error
    at previous steps along with $\lambda$. There is, unfortunately, no value of $\Delta x$
    which will {\em guarantee} the inequality holds, so stability is not guaranteed.
  \end{subproblem}
