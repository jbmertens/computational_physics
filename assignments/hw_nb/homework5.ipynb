    "## Lambda functions: Extra arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw above, while odeint supports the `args=()` we have seen in many places, `solve_ivp` does not! What do we do when the function that defines our system of first order differential equation requires extra arguments?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of approaches we can consider (and if you search online you will find some interesting ones). One would be to take the function we define that needs extra arguments, copy it, and hard code in values for the extra arguments, for each set of extra arguments required. However, this is not an idea I recommend. Another approach we can use and is known as lambda functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are familiar with functional programming then lambda functions are something you know. Though Python is a procedural language (like C, FORTRAN, Java, etc.) there are many things that can be done using the functional programming paradigm. Unfortunately we will not explore those here, we will focus on the one thing we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to understand them is that a lambda function is a simple function without a name that executes a single line of code and returns a value. We can assign a lambda function to a variable, pass it to another function, etc. Its basic structure is\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "lambda arg1,arg2 : do something with arg1 and arg2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There can be an arbitrary number of arguments and the \"do something\" is a single statement/expression that uses the arguments and produces a value. Notice that return is not needed and cannot be included.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a simplistic example, suppose I wanted to define a cosine function that accepted angles in degrees instead of radians. I could define this as a lambda function as\n",

    "```\n",

    "cosdeg(60)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "it should return 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use this idea below in the conjuction with `solve_ivp` (and in the future for other purposes). Before proceeding let us verify that our simplistic example really does what we claim; run the following cell."
