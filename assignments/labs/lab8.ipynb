    "We will be interested in computing the discrete Fourier transform of this equation, and manipulating it to solve for $\\phi$.\n",
    "We have seen that the conjugate variable of a timeseries is the frequency, i.e. when we have a time-dependent function in configuration space, the variable we work with in Fourier space is the frequency, $t \\leftrightarrow \\nu$. For spatial data, the conjugate variable is often referred to as the *wavevector*, which we will denote $k$. In two dimensions, we will have two conjugate variables, $x \\leftrightarrow k_x$ and $y \\leftrightarrow k_y$, and a corresponding wavevector $\\vec{k} = (k_x, k_y)$.\n",
